<h1>Library Management System</h1>
<p>
  The Library Management System is a comprehensive Java-based application developed as part of a college course. This project was created as a proof of concept and may not work on all devices. It features a full graphical user interface (GUI) that allows users to manage and interact with the library's resources.
</p>
<h2>Features</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>User Interface:</strong> A user-friendly interface displaying available books, their authors, and other relevant information.</li>
  <li><strong>User Accounts:</strong> Features for user login and registration, including a dedicated admin page for managing the system.</li>
  <li><strong>Book Management:</strong> Options to add new books and dictionaries to the library's catalog.</li>
  <li><strong>Logs and Reports:</strong> The system maintains detailed logs of all activities and transactions, accessible through the admin interface.</li>
  <li><strong>Financial Overview:</strong> Displays account balances and funds, helping users manage their library-related expenditures.</li>
</ul>
<p>
  This project highlights key aspects of software development, including UI design, database management, and the implementation of core Java programming concepts. Note that while the interfaces and login functionalities are fully implemented, the proof of concept nature means that some features may not work perfectly on all devices.
